## How can I help?
Any aspiring developer is welcome to fork and create a pull request to submit their content. **Programmers, texture artists, and 3D modelers** all have a place here.
- Textures are kept in *src/main/resources/assets/changed/textures*
- Java code is in *src/main/java/net/ltxprogrammer/changed*
- 3D models are kept in *src/main/java/net/ltxprogrammer/changed/client/renderer/model*

Even if **you aren't a developer**, you can help with **translations, documentation, or other simple issues**. However, any changes you make to the code or files should be on your own fork. **Create a pull request** when you are ready to submit any changes.

## How can I make my own sub-mod?
First, grab the [Forge MDK](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.18.2.html), and install **Intellij**. Add this line in your repositories (*build.gradle*): 

```gradle
maven {
    name = "Changed"
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LtxProgrammer/Changed-Minecraft-Mod/master/mcmodsrepo/"
}
```
Add this line in **your dependencies** (*build.gradle*):

```gradle
implementation fg.deobf("net.ltxprogrammer.changed:Changed-m${minecraftVersion}-f${forgeVersion}:${changedVersion}")
```
Then add a **mod dependency** to *mods.toml*:

```toml
[[dependencies.your_mod_id]]
    modId="changed"
    mandatory=true
    versionRange="[0.12b]" # Replace with the version you plan to mod
    ordering="NONE"
    side="BOTH"
```

You'll now have access to **all the tools** within the Changed: Minecraft Mod, good luck!

## General FAQ

**Will there be a Fabric/Quilt version?**

There are no current plans to port to another modloader, this is subject to change.

**Can you port the mod to 1.xx.x?**

We will not be porting the mod until it is deemed complete.

**Can you make the mod for Pocket Edition?**

If you're asking this, you're probably too young to be getting into Changed...

**What mods are compatible?**

There (hopefully) shouldn't be too many mods that are incompatible. If you do find a mod which behaves weird with Changed:MC, feel free to report it.

**What are the special forms for?**

Anyone who is a Tier 4 Patron get to design their own transfur variant exclusive to them, otherwise, the special syringe doesn't do anything.

**Will I lose my special form when I'm no longer a patron?**

No, but you will lose the in-game title and access to some discord channels.
