Changed:MC is a translation of the world of **Changed by DragonSnow** into Minecraft, inspired by alex_n_italy's Turned mod, it's built in mind with **transfurring**. It contains **structures, blocks, latex creatures, emotes**, and too many mixins. You can **become one of these creatures** and benefit from the upgrades (and suffer some downsides) of transfurring yourself.

## Gameplay FAQ

**How do I transfur?**
Use an infuser to infuse a blood-filled syringe, purify it (takes some time), then use the syringe on an IV rack next to a bed, and sleep in it. There is also a **gamerule** `changed:keepConscious` that will transfur you in places where you would normally be killed, it's off by default, and is entirely up to you if you want on.

Alternatively, with cheats, use `/transfur`.

**Okay, but how do I untransfur?**
*You can't.* Well,  **dying removes the transfur** and turns you back. This however can be prevented however with the **gamerule** `changed:keepForm`. The reasoning for this is that untransfurring isn't possible in the original game as stated by DragonSnow.

Once again, if you have cheats, use `/untransfur`.

**What are the syringe recipes?**
The recipes are given to you when you pick up a Latex Base, check the recipe book in the infuser table.

**How do I open the lab doors?**
The lab doors are locked when not powered, power them using redstone. When the lab doors are unlocked, you can open it like a regular door, but it will automatically close if it loses power.

## General FAQ

**Will there be a Fabric/Quilt version?**
There are no current plans to port to another modloader, this is subject to change.

**Can you port the mod to 1.xx.x?**
We will not be porting the mod until it is deemed complete.

**Can you make the mod for Pocket Edition?**
If you're asking this, you're probably too young to be getting into Changed...

**What mods are compatible?**
There (hopefully) shouldn't be too many mods that are incompatible. If you do find a mod which behaves weird with Changed:MC, feel free to report it on the GitHub.

**What are the special forms for?**
Anyone who is a Tier 4 Patron get to design their own transfur variant exclusive to them, otherwise, the special syringe doesn't do anything.

**Will I lose my special form when I'm no longer a patron?**
No, but you will lose the in-game title and access to some discord channels.
